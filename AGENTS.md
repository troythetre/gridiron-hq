## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Repository development notes

- Read [README.md](./README.md) for local setup, Supabase configuration, and
  manual platform smoke tests.
- [supabase/schema.sql](./supabase/schema.sql) is the checked-in reference for
  database tables, row-level security, and the signup trigger. The repository
  currently has no Supabase CLI migration or seed workflow.
- The project provides `npm run lint` and `npm run build`; there is no automated
  test script configured.
- Keep comments next to the implementation they explain. Prefer documenting
  non-obvious intent, constraints, and tradeoffs rather than restating what the
  code already says; update comments when behavior or framework terminology
  changes.
